.* What's LSDB

LSDB (The Lovely Sister Database) is a rolodex-like database program
for SEMI based MUA.  It's intended to be a lightweight relacement for
BBDB (The Insidious Big Brother Database).  Unfortunately, it
currently doesn't support the all features of BBDB.

.* Installation

.. (a) run in expanded place

If you don't want to install other directories, please do only
following:

	% make

You can specify the emacs command name, for example

	% make install EMACS=xemacs

If `EMACS=...' is omitted, EMACS=emacs is used.

.. (b) make install

If you want to install other directories, please do following:

	% make install

.. (c) install as a XEmacs package

If you want to install to XEmacs package directory, please do
following:

	% make install-package

.* MUA Specific Installation

There are the convenient ways to get the LSDB functions insinuate into
some particular MUA.  Only Semi-gnus and Wanderlust are currently
supported.

If you use Semi-gnus or its variant, put the following lines into your
~/.gnus and you will get the functions in this package autoloaded.

(autoload 'lsdb-gnus-insinuate "lsdb")
(autoload 'lsdb-gnus-insinuate-message "lsdb")
(add-hook 'gnus-startup-hook 'lsdb-gnus-insinuate)
(add-hook 'message-setup-hook
          (lambda ()
             (define-key message-mode-map "\M-\t" 'lsdb-complete-name)))

If you use Wanderlust, put the following lines into your ~/.wl:
(require 'lsdb)
(lsdb-wl-insinuate)
(add-hook 'wl-draft-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
             (define-key wl-draft-mode-map "\M-\t" 'lsdb-complete-name)))

If you use Mew, put the following lines into your ~/.mew:
(autoload 'lsdb-mew-insinuate "lsdb")
(add-hook 'mew-init-hook 'lsdb-mew-insinuate)
(add-hook 'mew-draft-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
             (define-key mew-draft-header-map "\M-\t" 'lsdb-complete-name)))

If you use MU-CITE, put the following lines into your ~/.emacs:
(autoload 'lsdb-mu-insinuate "lsdb")
(eval-after-load "mu-cite"
  '(lsdb-mu-insinuate))

.* Bug reports
If you found bugs, please drop a note to the EMACS-MIME Mailing List:

	emacs-mime-en@m17n.org	(English)
	emacs-mime-ja@m17n.org	(Japanese)

.* API
The API are quite simple but not written in a way that maximizes
flexibility.

.. Gathering Records
. : lsdb-update-records<f>
lsdb-update-records<f> is called from the buffer which contains raw
contents of MIME entity.  Once it is called, it returns a list of
records which could be gathered from the buffer.

.. Display Records
. : lsdb-display-record<f>
lsdb-display-record<f> takes only one record, pops up a window, and
displays the formatted contents of the record within the window.
If you want to multiple records such as search results at the same
time, use lsdb-display-records<f> instead.

.. Internal Data Model
. : lsdb-hash-table
lsdb-hash-table is the variable which holds all the records in LSDB.
You can operate on this variable in similar fashion to CL's
hash-table: lsdb-puthash for puthash, lsdb-gethash to gethash,
lsdh-maphash to maphash are available to you.  For example, you can
write the following expression to get the record for "Daiki Ueno":

(lsdb-gethash "Daiki Ueno" lsdb-hash-table)

.* Local emacs vars.
The following `outline-layout' local variable setting:
  - closes all topics from the first topic to just before the third-to-last,
  - shows the children of the third to last (config vars)
  - and the second to last (code section),
  - and closes the last topic (this local-variables section).
Local variables:
outline-layout: (0 : -1 -1 0)
End:
